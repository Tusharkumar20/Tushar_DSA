Given quetsions me user input nahi lena hai Scanner wagera se khud se Varible consider karke 
jaise int a = 5, int b = 7 khud se kar sakte hai goal is to build logic not learn all fuctions
or JAVA

Guys real simple questions please attempt all and if you have any questions at all please ask me on Group or personally on watsapp Everyone knows I have told people how to do a+b and a-b 
Please don't hesitate now matter how simple the doubt is some time small bugs like i++ and j++ can cause error so ask any time on group or personally 

1. Create Variable like int a = 5 or int b = 100 and Print it

2. Add Two Numbers and print it                                                                                                
  
3. Subtract Two Numbers and print it

4. Multiply Two Numbers and print it

5. Divide Two Numbers and print it

6. Add Three Numbers and print it

7. Print Numbers 1 to 10 Using Loop
Use a for loop to print numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

8. Print Numbers 5 to 1 Using Loop
Again use a for loop to print 5 4 3 2 1

9. Check if Two Numbers are Equal
Hint: Use if 
print Equal or Not Equal

10. Sum of Numbers from 1 to 5
Use a for loop

IUC Quetsions 
(If You Can) Do this questions if you feel confident you can or we will give answers of all or them tomorrow

1. Print first 5 even Numbers
print 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 using a loop

2. Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Use if else

3.Find the bigger number                                         
  Use If Else and print A is bigger or B is bigger  

4. Print Multiplication Table of 3
Use a loop to print 3 x 1 = 3 to 3 x 10 = 30

5. Print Squares of First 5 Numbers
Print 1 4 9 16 25 but not like just do System.out.print(1) and System.out.print(4)
Use a for loop
