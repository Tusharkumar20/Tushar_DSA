Task: Try each one on your own. Think step by step, try to write code on copy if possible kyuki dry run karne se copy pe concept clear ho jata hai, then check with code.                                                            
  
1. Create an array of size 5. Put values 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 in it. Print the 3rd value.
Hint: 3rd value means index 2 (arr[2])

2. What will this print?
If: arr[0] = 5;  
arr[1] = arr[0] + 3;  
System.out.println(arr[1]);  
Think: First value is 5, what will second be?

3. Change the last value of an array of size 4 to 99. Print it.
Hint: Last index = size - 1

4. If array has values 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 — print sum of 1st and last
Hint: arr[0] + arr[4]

5. Create array with 3 values. Set middle one to 100 and print all
Hint: Middle means index 1 in 3-sized array

6. Create array of size 4 and store values. Print all using 4 System.out.println() lines
Hint: Don’t use loop yet. Just access using arr[0], arr[1], etc.

7. Print the second value from an array only if it is greater than 50
Hint: Use if (arr[1] > 50)

8. If arr[2] = arr[0] + arr[1], and arr[0] = 4, arr[1] = 5, what is arr[2]?
Think: Just add and store

9. Create an array and make all values 1. Then print sum.
Hint: For size 4 → 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = ?

10. If arr[0] = 1; arr[1] = 3; arr[2] = arr[1] + 2; → what will arr[2] be?
Think step-by-step

IUC (If You Can) – For Extra Practice
Try these only if you’re comfortable with today’s questions.

IUC 1. Store 5 numbers in array: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 → Print all using a for loop
Hint: Loop from 0 to 4 and use arr[i] inside loop

IUC 2. Print the largest value among 3 array elements: 5, 9, 2
Hint: Use 2 if checks to find the biggest

IUC 3. Print only the values that are greater than 5 from this array: 2, 8, 1, 7
Hint: if (arr[i] > 5) inside loop

IUC 4. Count how many values are equal to 0 in an array
Hint: Make a counter. Increase it if arr[i] == 0

IUC 5. What will happen if you try to access arr[5] in array of size 4?
Hint: Array has index 0,1,2,3 — will throw error
