1. Create an array with values 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Print all even values only using a loop.
Hint: Even number = divisible by 2

2. Print the last value of the array using arr[arr.length - 1]

3. If first value is smaller than second, print “Increasing”
Hint: Use if (arr[0] < arr[1])

4. Count how many values are equal to 5 in this array: 5, 1, 5, 2, 5
Hint: Use int count = 0;  with loop

5. Create an array of size 4. Set all values to 7 using 4 lines. Then print all using loop.

6. If array has values 3, 6, 9, 12 — print sum of only the values at even indexes
Hint: even indexes → 0 and 2

7. Create array of 4 numbers. Print "OK" if the sum of first and last is equal to 15
Hint: arr[0] + arr[3] == 15

8. Find and print the smallest value from this array: 9, 2, 6, 4
Hint: Start with min = arr[0] and compare in loop

9. Make an array of size 3. Input values: 10, 20, 30. Then replace all values with 100 (manually). Print all.

10. Print the second-largest value in this array: 4, 8, 6
Hint: Find max and then secondMax

IUC – Day 6 Extra Practice

IUC 1. Print all values greater than 10 from array: 3, 15, 7, 20, 5

IUC 2. Make array: 5, 10, 15, 20. Replace only the middle two with 0. Print all.
Hint: change arr[1] and arr[2]

IUC 3. Find sum of all values that are not equal to 5 in array: 5, 3, 5, 2

IUC 4. From array: 11, 22, 33, 44, print values at odd indexes

IUC 5. Count how many values in array are divisible by 3: 3, 6, 8, 9, 10
