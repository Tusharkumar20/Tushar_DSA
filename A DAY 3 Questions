1. Check if a number is positive or negative 
Hint: Positive numbers are more than 0, negative are less than 0.

Example: 5 → Positive, -3 → Negative

2. Check if a number is even or odd (use %)
Hint: Even numbers leave 0 remainder when divided by 2.
Try dividing 6 ÷ 2 = 3 → remainder 0 → Even
Try dividing 7 ÷ 2 = 3 → remainder 1 → Odd

3. Check if a number is divisible by 5
Hint: Divisible by 5 means no remainder when divided by 5. (use %)
Example: 10, 15, 20 → all divisible by 5

4. Check if two numbers are equal or not
Hint: Think about the meaning of equal. use ==
Example: 5 and 5 → Equal; 7 and 8 → Not equal

5. Find which number is greater between two numbers
Hint: Compare both numbers. use >
Example: Compare 45 and 30 → 45 is greater

6. Check if a number is zero or not(== or use !=)                   

7. Check if a number is a multiple of 3
Hint: Multiples of 3 → 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 (use %)                                                                                                                        
Divide and see if there’s no remainder

8. Check if a number lies between 1 and 100
Hint: Number should be at least 1 and at most 100
Example: 5 → Yes, 120 → No

9. Check if a number is greater than 50 and less than 100
Hint: Both conditions must be true
Example: 75 → Yes, 40 → No

10. Check if a number is less than 10 or greater than 90
Hint: Either one condition is enough
Example: 5 → Yes, 95 → Yes, 50 → No

IUC (If You Can) — Stretch Questions
Try these if you feel confident. We’ll discuss them tomorrow in class!

IUC 1. Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5
Hint: Try 15, 30, 45 — all divisible by both

IUC 2. Check if a number has 3 digits
Hint: Number should be between 100 and 999

Examples: 345 → Yes, 99 → No

IUC 3. Check if a number is odd and greater than 50
Hint: Two conditions — is it odd? Is it more than 50?

IUC 4. Check if a number is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
Hint: It leaves a remainder with both 2 and 3

Try numbers like 7, 11, etc.

IUC 5. Check if a number is exactly between 10 and 20 (but not equal to 10 or 20)
Hint: It should be more than 10, less than 20

Example: 11 → Yes, 10 → No, 20 → No
