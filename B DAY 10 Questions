Day 10 – ASCII Value with Strings (Level 2)

Concepts used: ASCII values, charAt(), loops, if conditions with chars sab kuch aap ne padh rakha hai very easy agar aap ne akhri ke quetions kar rakhe hai to 
agar problem ho to please ask me and and try to do previous quetions again

1. Print the ASCII value of the last character in the string "Laptop"
Hint: Use print(s.charAt(s.length() - 1));

2. Print "Yes" if the first character of the string is in lowercase
Hint: lowercase means ASCII between 97 and 122 or use 
if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') print("yes"); agla quetions same tarike se hoga but useme (ch >='A' and ch<='Z') hoga understood 

3. Check if first character in "Robot" is between 'A' and 'Z'
Hint: Use char ch = s.charAt(0) and compare using ASCII

4. From "Tiger", print only the characters whose ASCII is greater than 100
Hint: Use a loop, compare s.charAt(i) > 100

5. Count how many uppercase letters are there in "GiraFFe"
Hint: Uppercase means ASCII between 65 and 90

6. Convert each lowercase letter in "hi" to uppercase using ASCII
Hint: ch = (char)(ch - 32)

7. Given string = "Good", print the sum of ASCII values of first and last characters
Hint: Add s.charAt(0) and s.charAt(s.length() - 1)

8. Given string = "Zero", print all characters with their ASCII values side-by-side
Hint: Loop through string and print ch + " = " + (int)ch

9. Print all vowels in the string "Education" using ASCII conditions only
Hint: check if char matches ASCII values of A, E, I, O, U, a, e, i, o, u

10. From the string "Smart", find the character with the highest ASCII value
Hint: Track maxChar and compare using if condition

IUC – If You Can (5 String + ASCII Value Challenges)

IUC 1. Print total ASCII sum of the string "Code"
Hint: Use loop, add each s.charAt(i)

IUC 2. If the string is "aBcD", convert only the lowercase to uppercase (ASCII method)
Hint: Check if ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z', then ch = (char)(ch - 32)

IUC 3. From "AirPlane", count how many characters have ASCII > 90
Hint: Use a counter inside a loop

IUC 4. Print all characters from "Hello123" that are not alphabets using ASCII
Hint: Use if condition to skip values between 65–90 and 97–122

IUC 5. From "APPLE", subtract 1 from ASCII of each char and print the new char
Hint: System.out.print((char)(ch - 1)) in loop
